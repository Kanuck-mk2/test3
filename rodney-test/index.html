      <p>Hello Chad! :D</p>
      <p>
        I have accepted your request but failed to properly clone the repository
        to my VSCode. I'll have to review that with you Friday morning. So here
        is me doing it the old fashioned way >:P
      </p>

        Hey Rodney, sorry now i understand the problem, disregard what i said in my last edit
        but at least i can git pull the changes you make to the repo i've made
        so thats progress!
      </p>

      <p>this is another message!</p>

      <p>Hello Chad! :D</p>
      <p>
        I have accepted your request but failed to properly clone the repository
        to my VSCode. I'll have to review that with you Friday morning. So here
        is me doing it the old fashioned way >:P
      </p>

        Hey Rodney, no this means its working properly!
        theres is no need to clone. Anyway just type 'git pull' to get the
        changes we make or check for any update i guess
